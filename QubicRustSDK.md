   - **Utilities**: Provides helper functions for tasks like URL construction and input validation.  

2. **Supported Endpoints**  

#### Ticks  
- `/latestTick`  
- `/ticks/{tickNumber}/tick-data`  
- `/ticks/{tickNumber}/approved-transactions`  
- `/ticks/{tickNumber}/chain-hash`  
- `/ticks/{tickNumber}/quorum-tick-data`  
- `/ticks/{tickNumber}/store-hash`  

#### Transactions  
- `/broadcast-transaction`  
- `/tx-status/{txId}`  
- `/v1/transactions/{txId}`  
- `/v1/tx-status/{txId}`  
- `/v1/identities/{identity}/transfer-transactions`  

#### Balances  
- `/balances/{addressID}`  
- `/balances/{id}`  

#### Smart Contracts  
- `/querySmartContract`  

#### Assets  
- `/assets/{identity}/issued`  
- `/assets/{identity}/owned`  
- `/assets/{identity}/possessed`  

#### Miscellaneous  
- `/status`  
- `/block-height`  
- `/v1/healthcheck`  
- `/v1/latest-stats`  

3. **Development Workflow**  

- **Initialization**  
  - Set up the Rust project using `cargo`.  
  - Integrate `reqwest` for HTTP requests, `tokio` for async runtime, and `serde` for JSON parsing.  

- **Module Implementation**  
  - Develop the `Client` module to handle API requests.  
  - Implement endpoint-specific modules, starting with high-priority features like transactions and balances.  

- **Testing**  
  - Write unit tests using mock API responses.  
  - Develop integration tests against a live test API.  

- **Documentation**  
  - Add inline documentation using `rustdoc`.  
  - Provide example usage in the `examples/` directory.  

- **Release**  
  - Publish the library to `crates.io` with a comprehensive README.
