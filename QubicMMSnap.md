## Technical Implementation Overview  

### Key Enhancements  

1. **Modularized Handlers**  
   - Separate logic for `getPublicId` and `signTransaction` into dedicated functions for better maintainability.  

2. **Configuration Centralization**  
   - Store constants in a `config.js` file for easier modifications.  

3. **Improved Validation and Error Handling**  
   - Use `ajv` for stricter parameter validation.  
   - Implement custom error classes for granular error reporting.  

4. **Performance Optimizations**  
   - Replace manual Base64 conversions with `Buffer`-based operations.  
   - Optimize cryptographic functions for efficiency.  

5. **Enhanced Security**  
   - Introduce nonce-based replay attack protection.  
   - Use constant-time comparison to mitigate timing attacks.  
   - Encrypt sensitive data in memory.  

6. **Testing Framework**  
   - Establish a robust testing framework using Jest for unit tests and Postman for integration tests.  

7. **User Experience Improvements**  
   - Refine user prompts for better clarity and context.  
   - Provide user-friendly error messages.
