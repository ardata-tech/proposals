## Details

### What is OpenQubicLib?

We propose to develop **OpenQubicLib**, a **foundational smart contract library** that will provide secure, tested, and reusable smart contract components for the Qubic ecosystem. Similar to OpenZeppelin's role in the Ethereum ecosystem, OpenQubicLib will serve as the standard library for secure smart contract development in Qubic. The library will include implementations for:

- Token standards (fungible and non-fungible)
- Ownership and access control
- Security patterns and utilities
- Governance mechanisms
- Mathematical utilities and safe operations
- Interface standards

A portion of any commercial licensing fees (10%) will be allocated back to the Qubic Ecosystem Fund.
